# Trooper Database

## A Play on Login Website that shows information about two 3d models of Arachnids - Hopper & Warrior. Made with Express and SQL(PostgreSQL) for the backend and React with Tailiwind for the Frontend

 - Deploying to netlify with the backend folder was giving errors so I used just the frontend folder.
 - The whole project repo can be found here [LoginSystemV1](https://github.com/TSEidolon/loginSystemV1)

p.s. Click the Guest Login Button on the Login Page to gain entry to the Main Area. Also backend only works locally
